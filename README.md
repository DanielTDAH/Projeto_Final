#Gerenciamento De Eventos: BPE

Este website que foi criado para ajudar você no gerenciamento dos eventos da forma mais simples e eficiente possível. Through it, you may initiate new events, along the list of existent events, and even delete events not needed anymore.

Você pode fazer o seguinte aqui:

1. Criar um Evento

On the “Create Event” tab, you can conveniently enter the event information into the system just by inserting the data the event has. You can simply add the name of the event,

Event name

Data do evento

Local

Description

Capacidade máxima de participantes

After you have entered these fields and submitted the form, the event is recorded and automatically included in the event list.

2. Visualizar Eventos

In "List Events", the user is able to see all the registered events. In that list, users will see details such as:

Event name

Date and time

Location

Description

Participants]

3. Deletar um Evento

If you wish to remove the event from the list, the only thing you need to do is to click on the Delete button beside the event that you want to remove. But this deletes the event completely from the database.

How does it work?

The system is very straightforward and you just need to follow the instructions. You create an event by filling out the form which is then stored in a database. Afterward, you can review created events or simply delete the ones that are not needed anymore.

Main features:

Create Event: Fill out the form and register the event.

List Events: See all the events that are currently running

Delete Event: Take off an event from the list when the event is no longer necessary.

Behind the scenes:

The website is built using PHP and MySQL. Php controls form submission and links with the database whilst MySQL is the one that keeps all the event information. The interface is really intuitive as it is created with HTML and CSS, and more interactivity was added through JavaScript and jQuery.
